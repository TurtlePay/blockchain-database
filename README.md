## Overview

Provides a mechanism and interface for storing the TurtleCoin¬Æ blockchain in a relational database.

## Prerequisites

- TurtleCoin¬Æ >= 1.0.0
- node >= 12
- One of the following DBMS
    - MariaDB/MySQL with InnoDB support
    - Postgres *or* a Postgres compatible SQL interface
    - SQLite (built-in)

## Hardware Requirements

Requirements vary depending on what DBMS you use; however, generally speaking, for the best performance as of **September 15, 2020**, your DBMS must have the minimum of the following:

* 256GB RAM
  * 224GB dedicated to MariaDB/MySQL
* 8 CPU Cores (16 Recommended)
* SSD Storage

**Note**: Its possible and advisable that in lieu of operating large systems that you utilize a DBMS that allows for sharding/clustering and load balancing connections to the system(s). Please refer to your DBMS documentation for more information.

***Warning***: Running the DB on system(s) with less than the minimum hardware requirements above will cause performance issues. If you are experiencing issues please verify that the system you are using meets the minimum requirements above. We cannot assist with performance issues with implementations that do not meet the above minimum requirements.

## Recommended Reading

The help tune your selected DBMS, we recommend that you read the following documents, at a minimum, to tune your DBMS installation for the dataset this package manages.
